Such topics can be taught using GPS tracking systems as a learning aid.<\/p><p>Students are required to understand how GPS and technology systems can provide analysis for players in the form of match analysis.<\/p><p>Game analysis using GPS systems will show the movement of specific players during a game or competitive situation.<\/p><p>Speed, distance covered and position on the pitch can give data on match involvement and intensity.  Heat maps and graphs of game involvement including sprinting, jogging and direction of movement are methods used to display the data.<\/p><p>The power of GPS Player Vests for sport in schools partly lie in gathering GPS data over time. It builds up a picture; of fluctuations that can be explored and students can compare GPS metrics over time periods.<\/p><p>GPS used in training sessions can show distances covered in specific times for each individual. Increases in training intensity, speed and the attainment and maintenance of pre-set training zone velocities can be displayed for the class to study.<\/p><p>Links with the energy systems and types of training can be highlighted here in class discussions.<\/p><p>A player heat map can highlight positional play and could be used to discuss tactics or demonstrate the individual player qualities.<\/p><p>Elite sports are using GPS technology to help in player recruitment where the study of GPS data helps to identify the players who have the physical attributes in terms of speed and fitness required by coaches in professional teams.<\/p><p>Demonstrating such levels of professionalism has the bonus of being attractive to the players being scouted by the club or team.<\/p><p>The benefits of GPS technology can be highlighted to show how coaches could <a href=\"\/pages\/performance\" title=\"Performance\">improve player performance<\/a> by using data, player heat maps and the level of player involvement in the game.<\/p>",
